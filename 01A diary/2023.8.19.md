## Today is a special day

Today is my **first day** to keep a diary by **vim** on Kai-0-Windows11. And it's also a **beginning** of recording my trivial affairs in English. And the most important thing is that it's the first day as a senior high school student!

I almost configure my vim all the day, and the sense of creation made me satisfied. And I hope I can create more stuff which is mine alone.

## Never forget be you a person who wanna be

I always be fascinated by something different from what i am doing.
But I do have a dream: *Be a philosopher and physicist*

So I do have a lot of enthusiasm about for physics class, but only in class.
It's makes me more and more **painful**. On the one hand this behavior like a cop-out, on the other hand it will take me further and further from my dream.

I can be **decadent** any more! I decide try my best during the three years senior high school life. Do a very best to success the physics competition!
