I haven't written the diary for many days. Honestly speaking, it's mainly because I was reconfiguring my computer system and I am lazy.

And there's a pity that the *charts bed* I used to write my notes can no longer be used. **It means the pictures in my notes were all lost**!

## Remain silent in the unfamiliar



This month is embarrassing for me. There are two unlucky things happen in me.

1. When my biology teacher was talking about  amino acids(氨基酸), he said,

   > "In chemistry, it may be considered that substances composed of amino groups(氨基) and carboxyl groups(羧基) are amino acids."

   I nodded to him.

   > "Nod? Like hell! I totally disagree with this opinion!"

   With my face turn to red, I feel terribly embarrassed and wronged.

2. In math class, the teacher let us write down the basic properties of inequalities. But I only heard "basic". Three times in total I yelled,

   > "Basic inequalities haven't been taught yet!"

   When everybody looked at me, I suddenly realized how stupid my words were. 

So, just **keep silent and calm before you already fully understood**!
