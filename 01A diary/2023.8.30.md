Today is the last day of the drill. From the drill, I learned *Don't expect somebody will give you a chance to show who you are. You can only show yourself **on your own initiative** unless you don't have passtion to go social at all.* 

I have a new dream that I wanna be the God! It sounds crazy and impossible, and it IS crazy and impossible. Because **nobody can grasp the world**.

For example

q: why Chinese have food by chopstick?

a: Because chopstick is convenient to be used.

q: Why people prefer to use convenient things.

a: Because people wanna save time to do other things they love.

q: Why people will love something?

a: Maybe because people usually believe in romanticism.

q: Why people has a faith?

a: Everyone knows that, people need a faith.

> Yes, everyone knows it,but nobody knows why.

Not only about *Why people needs a faith*, and also about *Why there are physics rules.* Such as *Why there are gravity, electromagnetism, weak interaction and strong interaction?*

Nobody knows it, they're rules of the world. Only God knows it. This is why I wanna be the God.

I wanna know the final answer of the world.
