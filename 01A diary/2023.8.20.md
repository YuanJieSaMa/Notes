## Be free and alone

When I am a junior high school student, my math teacher told me: 
> Be free and alone.

And today I actually feel the advantages of **being free and alone**.

1. I can have more time to think. I really need a lot of time to think, so it's pretty helpful to do!
2. I can do my work more concentratively, it's like a **gravitation field model**: 
> You can't pay attention to ignore others' voice, but you can pay attention to your job, and you will not hear their voice. It's like a gravitation field because if you ignore their voice, you just try to escape the gravitation field, it's hard! But if you're **attracted by your job**, it seem you're attracted by another gravitation field, and the original gravitation field no longer do work on you!
3. I can save a lot of energy because I needn't show how I am as a person for other one. So I can pay more time for doing something I passionate about without caring other people's sight.

## Clam and try the best

Today, I took the placement test. When I took the Chinese exam, I feel very tense because I always feel the paper will be collected soon so that I try to finish the paper as quickly as possible. But in fact, when I finished the paper, there is a half an hour left.

It makes my problem solving processes are cursory. If investigating the causes, It's caused by my **tense, sloppy and wanna give up**.

So I have to be clam and try the best whatever how terrible the things go.
